                My Journey in Learning Programming
              </h3>
              <p>
                Programming has been a passion of mine for the past three years. I started my journey by learning languages like <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong>, which formed the foundation of my skills. As a third-year Computer Engineering student at <strong>Al-Quds University in Palestine</strong>, I’ve been deeply immersed in coding. These languages have taught me not only the technical aspects of programming but also the importance of logical thinking and problem-solving.

                <p>Currently, I am working on a significant project: an online exam system. This project is part of my effort to improve my Java skills, a language I have grown to appreciate for its versatility and widespread use. The goal of this system is to create a platform where exams can be administered and graded online, providing both students and teachers with a smooth experience. I’ve faced several challenges along the way, particularly in handling user input validation and security, but each challenge has been an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

              <p> My childhood was shaped by a balance of academics, sports, and creativity. I grew up in private schools where I excelled in both studies and athletics, especially in sprinting competitions where I became known for my speed. I also developed a strong interest in mental intelligence, which helped me improve my mathematical and cognitive skills, making me quick at problem-solving. Alongside sports, I nurtured my passion for art and was a skilled painter. Soccer and tennis taught me teamwork, discipline, and how to push my limits. These diverse experiences in sports, learning, and creativity laid the foundation for my personal growth and continue to inspire me in my pursuits today.</p>
